# Agile Process

The planning and maintenance of all significant functionality will be managed within the following JIRA.
	https://sphere42.atlassian.net/
    
The name of this projects board is Mile Stone Project - 5 (MSP05).
	*Credentials to this management tool will be provided to Code Institute during submission

All project wireframes, UX design details and database diagrams have been included within the applicable EPIC/User story ticket.
There is the potential for variance between the initial UX design and the final product as the design will be adjusted based on feedback from User Acceptance Testing (both alpha and beta cycles).

Notes:
* This project will progress utilising Agile methodology. 
* Development cycles/iterations/sprints will be 7 days in length.
* Initial Epics to be created for the project will be:
  * Project Initial Setup
  * Customer Membership
  * Static Information Pages
  * Subscriptions

Additional features/Epics will be added as the project/product progresses.

At the beginning of each sprint, there will be a planning session to determine the sprint goal and the stories to be included in the sprint.

Twice a sprint there will be a short refinement session to which current tickets are further refined and additional epics/user stories are added/refined to the backlog.

At the end of each sprint there will be a review session to demo what has been developed during the sprint.

Development progress is visible in the JIRA board and history of the tickets.

Defects will also be maintained within JIRA. High-level details will be contained within the [TESTING.md]() file.

Development of the MVP will be conducted on the local dev environment. 
Once a stable MVP is available, initial deployment to heroku will occur.
From there development will continue along side User Testing.

Below are screen captures of all available epics, user stories and tasks.
