# Benefits and Rational

At a High level this site will provide:
* A Coffee subscription service
* A Newsletter subscription
* Ability to leave feedback

# User Stories and Functional Requirements

The planning and maintenance of all significant functionality will be managed within the following JIRA.
	https://sphere42.atlassian.net/
    
The name of this projects board is called Mile Stone Project - 5.
	*Credentials to this management tool will be provided to Code Institute during submission

A copy of the Agile project structure (Epics, User Stories (with points), and tasks) can be found within the [AGILE.md]().

All project wireframes, UX design details and database diagrams have been included within the applicable EPIC/User story ticket.
There is the potential for variance between the initial UX design and the final product as the design will be adjusted based on feedback from User Acceptance Testing (both alpha and beta cycles).

Notes:
* This project will progress utilising Agile methodology. 
* Development cycles/iterations/sprints will be 7 days in length.
* Initial Epics to be created for the project will be:
  * Project Initial Setup
  * Customer Membership
  * Static Information Pages
  * Subscriptions

Additional features/Epics will be added as the project/product progresses. The Final and complete list of Epics will be included in the [AGILE.md]().

At the beginning of each sprint, there will be a planning session to determine the sprint goal and the stories to be included in the sprint.

Twice a sprint there will be a short refinement session to which current tickets are further refined and additional epics/user stories are added/refined to the backlog.

At the end of each sprint there will be a review session to demo what has been developed during the sprint.

Development progress is visible in the JIRA board and history of the tickets.

Defects will also be maintained within JIRA. High-level details will be contained within the [TESTING.md]() file.

Development of the MVP  will be conducted on the local dev environment. 
Once a stable MVP is available, initial deployment to Heroku will occur.
From there development will continue alongside User Testing.

NOTE: Potential test cases for automation will be identified during the manual exploratory test sessions. 

However the creation of a full automation test framework will be dependant on a review of the cost vs benefit analysis of its implementation. This assessment will be conducted at the end of sprint two and included within the [TESTING.md]() document.

# Testing 

Full details and evidence of testing conducted throughout the software development life cycle of this project will be maintained in a seperate document called [testing.md]().

At a high level testing will include:
- ~~Automated JavaScript Unit Tests~~
- ~~Automated Python Unit Tests~~
- ~~Automated functional tests~~
- Manual exploratory test sessions
- User Acceptance testing (both Alpha and Beta test cycles)
- Performance Testing
- Security Review

A review will be conducted at the end of sprint 2 to determine if the benefits of implementing an automated test framework outweight the cost and development requirements

# Deployment Process

## Direct Deployment
The site was deployed to Heroku with AWS as the cloud location for all static and media files
- These deployment steps assume you have already setup AWS, run the collectstatic commands and will be using the default postgreSQL database on Heroku

The steps to deploy to Heroku are as follows:
1. Create the requirements document by running the following command in your terminal
  1. pip freeze > requirements.txt
1. Create a runtime.txt file in the root directory
  1. this file should contain the version of python used to develop the project (python-3.8.12)
1. Create a Procfile file (include no extention in its creation) in the root directory
  1. add "web: gunicorn studyWorld.wsgi --log-file -" into the file
1. Once the code is present and up to date, go to the [Heroku website](https://www.heroku.com/). If not already signed up for a free account, please do so.
1. On the Heroku Dashboard, select the option for New App, (note you can have up to five applications live with a free heroku account)
1. The site will then request an app name (this must be unique) and a region
![Heroku App creation]()
1. Next you will need to tell the Heroku platform what Buildpacks are required, this is done in the Buildpack section on the settings screen
![Add Buildpack]()
1. For this project you will need to add the Python Buildpack
![Python Buildpack]()
1. Next you will need to add the secrete keys and AWS configuration keys for you project. So far these parameters were contained in the .env file
![configuration]()
1. Connect the app to your project code in Github via the deployment screen
![Add Github connection]()
1. Deploying to Heroku can be done one of two ways:
    1. Automatically, which will mean the project will be with the latest code available each time it is loaded
    1. Manually, which will build the application as per the code available at the time of build. Any changes to the repository will not be added unless the manual build request is utilised again.
![Screen to Deploy]()
1. Once the build and deployment is complete the following message should appear
1. Done, your application is now deployed
